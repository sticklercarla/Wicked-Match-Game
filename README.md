# Wicked Match Game

Match Game built with a vanilla Javascript frontend and Rails API backend. Login to view your account or create an account (no authentications in the app). Once logged in you can see your past game scores and play new games. Check out the leaderboard to view all the high scores and click on the rules to see how to play. Play a game by clicking on a card and finding the witches that match. Score is based on each turn which is every two card clicks. 

Built the game functionality along with pair programmer Lorena Ramirez-Lopez: https://github.com/DaleLore
